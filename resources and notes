7. template inheritance
ex::

{% extends "base.html"%}

{% block head_title %}  {{block.super}} {% endblock head_title %}

{% block content%}


8.including a template inside a template
{% include 'snippets/nav.html' %}


9. for using class based views we need to import
from django.views import View   #imported because we are using class based view


10.for using template based views (this is best)
from django.views.generic import TemplateView  #for template based views
it can be written in urls.py directly


11.To have a look at model ,,register it in admin
Ex.:: 

from .models import RestaurantLocation

admin.site.register(RestaurantLocation) 

12. slug

slug is short and meaningful label or name. Basically used for urls looking simple and robust


13. run django page on mobile:

ubuntu::

a. run this cmd;
  ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1

  it will give some ip's (try below steps with all except localhost, 127.0.0.1)
  ex: if ip is 162.250.103.1

  step1:run this on terminal :
  python manage.py runserver 162.250.103.1:8000  

  also add 162.250.103.1 to ALLOWED_HOST (ALLOWED_HOST=['162.250.103.1'])

  step2:
  open http://162.250.103.1:8000  on laptop
  open 162.250.103.1:8000   on mobile
